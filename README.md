This project is a C++ Hostel Management System built with object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

It allows hostel administrators to manage the following:

Student Management – register students, assign rooms, track attendance.

Staff Management – register hostel staff with roles.

Room Management – allocate and deallocate rooms dynamically.

Fee Management – add and track student fees, overdue payments.

Visitor Management – record visitor details and purpose.

Notices & Maintenance – send notices, handle maintenance requests.

Mess Scheduling – add and view meal times.

The system uses C++ classes, STL (vectors, maps), and file handling to simulate a real-world hostel environment.
